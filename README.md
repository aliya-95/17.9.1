# Homework 17.9.1
Write a program that asks for a sequence of numbers separated by a space, and also asks the user for any number.

As a task of an increased level of complexity, you can perform a compliance check specified in the data entry condition.

Then the program works according to the following algorithm:

Convert the input sequence to a list

Sort a list in ascending order of the elements in it (define a function to implement sorting)

Sets the position number of the element that is less than the number entered by the user, and the one following it is greater than or equal to this number.

When setting the position of an element, use the binary search algorithm that was covered in this module. Implement it as a separate function as well.
